# EllipticPDELocalizedRadialSol.jl

EllipticPDELocalizedRadialSol.jl is a Julia package to prove the existence of localised radial solutions of semilinear elliptic equations as described in Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3 of the paper [Constructive proofs for localised radial solutions of semilinear elliptic systems on $\mathbb{R}^d$](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6544/ad0278).

## Executing the proofs

[Download this repository](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/EllipticPDELocalizedRadialSol.jl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and execute the file `run_proofs.jl` located in the folder [proofs](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/EllipticPDELocalizedRadialSol.jl/tree/main/proofs).
